                        <p>Eating a balanced diet provides your body with the nutrients it needs to function properly and support physical activity. Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining healthy bodily functions and optimal athletic performance. Exercise is essential for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and cardiovascular health. Rest and sleep are crucial for allowing your body to recover and repair after exercise and other physical activities. Finally, managing stress can help prevent chronic disease, improve mental health, and support healthy relationships.

                <ul class="accordion-list">
                    <li>
                        <h3>How much cardio should I be doing?</h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>With cardio, the amount you’re doing depends on a lot of different factors: your current activity level, your goals, and how hard you’re working. If you’re currently sedentary, general recommendations of around 150 minutes of moderate cardio each week (about 30 minutes most days of the day), would be way too much. In that case, you’d start with shorter rounds: 10-15 minutes each day of easy cardio (like walking) and build on from there.</p>
                            
                            <p>If your goal is strength and lean muscle gains, you don’t want to do too much cardio.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>How often should I rest?</h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>Rest is such a huge piece of the fitness puzzle and it’s easy to forget that the magic happens when we REST. This is when the body is able to restore its levels, rebuild muscle, and gather energy and fuel for the next session. If you’re constantly working yourself into the ground, there’s a point where you’ll hit diminishing returns. Too much exercise can lead to overtraining, which can potentially cause elevated resting heart rate, injury, poor sleep, low energy levels, depression/anxiety, agitation, decrease in performance, and extreme soreness/pain.
                            The amount of rest you need will also depend on your current routine, how quickly you recover, your fueling strategies, and the intensity of your workouts. If you’re working out at intense levels a few times each week, you may need more rest time to recover in between sessions. If your workouts are lower-intensity, you could possibly work out every day without the effects of overtraining. Make sure you have at least 1-2 days of full rest each week to allow the body to repair and prevent overtraining.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Should I stretch before my workouts?</h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>Research is mixed on this, so if you don’t want to stretch, you can skip it! Static stretching before a workout has actually been shown to DECREASE speed and performance. If you’re going to stretch before a workout, use this chance to move your body through full range of motion exercises to prepare for the workout you’re about to do. Your warmup moves should mimic the “meat” of your workout and include dynamic stretching. Static stretching (holding for 15-25 seconds per stretch) is a better choice AFTER your workout. You can foam roll either before or after your workout.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>How much weight should I be lifting when I strength train?</h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>When you choose a weight for strength training, pick a weight that’s “heavy for you.” For example, 5 lbs may be heavy for one person, while 50 lbs is heavy for someone else. This will depend on your current strength and fitness level.
                            You should be able to complete all reps in a set with good form, and have to push yourself to finish the last 1-2 reps of each set. If you could easily breeze through 15-20 reps of an exercise at your current weight, it’s a good sign to bump it up a little. On the other hand, if you’re struggling to complete all reps and compromising form, decrease the amount of weight or resistance you’re using.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What should I do about muscle soreness?</h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>Contrary to common belief, sore muscles do not mean that you had a *good workout* and you shouldn’t aim to be seriously sore after each session. I find that when clients are super sore, it hinders their activity level for the rest of the day and days following the workout.  For this reason, we take it easy on the first session because no matter what we do, it’s different and new, which means they’ll be a tiny bit sore.
                            What’s the benefit of pushing yourself super hard so you can’t move the rest of the week? If your muscles are incredbily sore, focus on adequate water and protein intake, stretch your muscles (dynamic and static stretching feels great), a bath with epsom salts, and magnesium oil. Easy cardio and moving the legs can help to reduce soreness. Also, if you have a sauna blanket or access to a sauna, this is an incredible recovery tool for sore muscles and inflammation. Make sure you’re designating 1-2 days as a recovery day during the week, too.</p>

                            <p>As always, talk with a doctor before making any fitness changes. The best way to start a fitness program is consistent walking and establishing a cardio baseline. Aim for 5-15 minutes most days of the week. Once you’re able to hit this consistently for a few weeks, add in 5 minutes until you can reach the 150 minutes of moderate cardio guidelines. (30 minutes, 5 days per week) From here, I recommend meeting with a certified personal trainer to determine a personalized strength plan you can follow 1-2 days per week. (One upper, one lower, or two total body circuits) From here, you’ll be able to progress into different strength training styles and methods depending on your goals, but I love starting with walking!</p>

                            <p>This depends on intensity and your goals. If your goal is general movement, your ideal amount of workout days will be different than someone who is training for a grueling athletic event. You could train 2-7 times per week, depending on intensity. Make sure to vary intensity in your workout plan each week so you have a mix of challenging, easy, and moderate intensity levels. Always include 1-2 days of full rest. Need help creating a workout plan? Here’s a post I did all about this.</p>
